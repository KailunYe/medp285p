My name is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kelen_yee?igsh=OWo4YjNuYWRzMmtn&utm_source=qr" target="_blank">Kailun Ye</a>, and I am a senior student at Hunter College. Originally from China, I now reside in Queens, New York. I have a strong passion for creativity, which I express through designing and developing websites, creating animations, and producing videos. My interest in innovative projects has been a significant part of my life, driving me to explore new ideas and technologies.
