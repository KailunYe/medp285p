             <h2>Health & Grooming</h2>
            <p>
                Health and grooming are essential for your dog‚Äôs quality of life. From regular brushing to proper nutrition, maintaining your dog‚Äôs physical and mental well-being requires consistent care and attention. Here are some essential tips to help you keep your furry friend healthy and happy:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Regular Brushing:</strong> Brushing your dog‚Äôs coat not only removes dead hair and keeps their coat shiny but also helps prevent matting. For long-haired breeds, brushing every few days is ideal, while shorter-haired breeds may need less frequent grooming.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. Proper Nutrition:</strong> A balanced diet is vital to your dog‚Äôs health. Ensure that their food is rich in nutrients, high in protein, and tailored to their breed, age, and activity level. Always provide fresh water, and consult your vet for specific dietary needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. Dental Care:</strong> Regular dental care prevents plaque build-up, gum disease, and bad breath. Use a dog-specific toothbrush and toothpaste, and aim to brush their teeth several times a week.
